# Bad-Apple-Windows
Bad apple played on multiple windows.

## About this app
This is a idea I had while programming and I was surprised to find that It was not done before, so here it is, In all of It's glory. Bad Apple played on multiple windows in Microsoft Windows.

## Resources folder
The res folder contains all the frames of the video, you can change them to be anything else or even change the resolution. If you choose to compile the app yourself, you will notice a unused function, SplitDahResolution(), creative name, I know. But this function will split all the files in 1/2 resolution.
The resolution adjusts automatically too. So you can make the video any resolution you'd like!

The `res` folder is in `res.zip`. The folder must be in the same directory as the executable. It contains the music and the frames

## Compiling
Please add all the required dependencies in the Dependencies folder. 

The UI is made with [Codrut Visual Library](https://github.com/Codrax/CodrutsVisualLibrary), so you will need to install that. Or, you can just delete all the components and replace them with classic VCL components, It's not required to install this library.
